The property is just across the famous promenade from Niceâ€™s popular pebble beach, and next door to the landscaped Mediterranean gardens of the Massena Palace Museum of Art and History. Many restaurants, art galleries, and shops are closeby, while itâ€™s only a ten minute stroll to Niceâ€™s Old Town (â€˜Vieux Villeâ€™), where narrow and shaded streets are lined by historic houses and churches.
